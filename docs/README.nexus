[size=3][u][b]What is fixed?[/b][/u][/size]

The research display UI incorrectly visualizes research dependencies, by showing some not existing ones. This mod corrects that logic to ensure all dependencies are displayed as intended.
Usually it is not seen, except the research has multiple dependencies on a second and next steps and there dependency items has "upper" steps of research dependencies too.

Instead of many words several pictures that shows the difference.

[size=3][u][i]Vanilla research lines and items[/i][/u][/size]

There is how to looks vanilla research screen. Let's focus on the [b]Ship Mods[/b] research lines.

[size=3][u][i]Example research item with multiple dependencies[/i][/u][/size]

[code]
<ware id="research_test_ware_for_display_fix" name="Test research" description="This is simple test research for the Research dependency display fix" transport="research" volume="1"
  tags="research" sortorder="800">
  <price min="1" average="1" max="1" />
  <research time="10">
    <research>
      <ware ware="research_mod_ship_mk1" />
      <ware ware="research_mod_engine_mk1" />
      <ware ware="research_mod_shield_mk1" />
      <ware ware="research_mod_weapon_mk1"/>
    </research>
  </research>
</ware>
[/code]

i.e. [b]research_test_ware_for_display_fix[/b] requires four other research items to be completed first. But nothing else is required, and next steps of this research "lines" has no dependencies on new research item and have not cross interdependencies too.

[size=3][u]Without the fix[/u][/size]

There is a mess, instead of simple dependency [b]Test research[/b] on other four research items ...
